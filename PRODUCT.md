# Product — Zagel (زاجل)

<!-- impeccable:product-schema 1 -->

## Platform

web

## Users

Primary users are software developers, technical founders, indie hackers, and system administrators running microservices, web apps, CRM platforms, or automation workflows that require automated WhatsApp notifications, one-time passwords (OTP), and two-way messaging without complex multi-container Docker setups or vendor lock-in.

## Product Purpose

Zagel (زاجل) provides a lightweight, standalone, single-container REST API gateway and developer command center that bridges external backends (Python, Node.js, PHP, Go, cURL, webhooks) with WhatsApp. Inspired by the legendary carrier pigeon (حمام زاجل) that pioneered rapid messaging, Zagel is engineered for zero-friction deployment (local workstations, VPS Linux hosts, standalone Docker, and managed cloud platforms), resilient connection management with Baileys, complete API key lifecycle governance, and an intuitive, production-grade developer cockpit.

## Positioning

Unlike heavy WhatsApp enterprise solutions that require separate databases (PostgreSQL, Redis) and multi-container Docker Compose stacks, Zagel is self-contained in a single lightweight process/container, persists sessions reliably to disk or MongoDB, offers a built-in cryptographic API token manager, and serves an integrated real-time Developer Cockpit with zero external dependencies.

## Operating Context

- Used in local developer environments (`localhost:7860`), Linux VPS instances, Docker containers, and cloud container platforms.
- Interacts with Baileys WebSocket protocol connected to WhatsApp mobile devices via QR code or 8-digit pairing code.
- Consumed via standard HTTP REST requests (`POST /api/messages/send`, `POST /api/otp/send`, `POST /api/otp/verify`, etc.) with `x-api-key` or `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

## Capabilities and Constraints

### Capabilities
- **Zero-Trust Master Admin Security**: Dual-tier privilege architecture where Master Admin Key (`ADMIN_API_KEY`) protects session pairing (QR and 8-digit codes), token governance, activity audit logs, and webhooks; glassmorphic UI Security Gate modal prevents unauthorized dashboard access.
- **Token & Key Lifecycle Management**: Built-in cryptographic API key generation (`wa_live_...`), metadata labeling, revoking, persistent local key storage, timing-safe auth verification, and `.env` fallback.
- **Whitelist Recipient & Dynamic UI Placeholders**: Configurable test and display recipient (`WHITELIST_PHONE_NUMBER`) powering automated integration test suites and dynamically populating Cockpit form placeholders and code examples.
- **Messaging**: Single message dispatch, bulk message queues, media messages (images, documents, audio), delivery status feedback.
- **OTP Engine**: Cryptographically random 6-digit passcodes, in-memory expiration tracking, rate-limiting per phone number, configurable expiry windows, and verification.
- **Webhooks**: Outbound event delivery for incoming messages and delivery receipts.
- **Developer Cockpit**: High-contrast dark dashboard with live connection telemetry, interactive API playground with instant cURL/Python/Node/Go snippet generation, token manager, and live activity feed.

### Constraints
- Must remain zero-dependency regarding external databases (uses local file system/JSON storage with atomic writes).
- Must adhere strictly to WhatsApp anti-spam safeguards (configurable rate limiting, throttled bulk dispatches).
- Express.js 5.x ES modules architecture running on Node 20+.

## Evidence on Hand

- Runnable Express server at [src/server.js](file:///D:/vs-code/whatsapp-gateway/src/server.js) and [src/app.js](file:///D:/vs-code/whatsapp-gateway/src/app.js).
- Embedded Baileys implementation at [src/services/baileys.service.js](file:///D:/vs-code/whatsapp-gateway/src/services/baileys.service.js).
- Existing test suite at [test-api.js](file:///D:/vs-code/whatsapp-gateway/test-api.js).
- Current HTML/CSS/JS frontend in `src/public/`.

## Product Principles

1. **Zero External Dependencies**: Keep deployment to a single container or node process without mandating Redis or relational databases.
2. **Fail Securely & Explicitly**: Timing-safe authentication, strict validation, granular HTTP error codes, and helpful remediation messages.
3. **Developer Ergonomics First**: Make onboarding take under 2 minutes with instant copy-paste code snippets, one-click token generation, and real-time status feedback.
4. **Resilient Session Lifecycle**: Protect against sudden WhatsApp disconnects with automatic socket recovery, watchdog health checks, and state transparency.

## Accessibility & Inclusion

- WCAG 2.1 AA compliant contrast ratios throughout the developer cockpit.
- Full keyboard navigability for forms, tabs, modal dialogs, and token management tables.
- Accessible ARIA status announcements for dynamic connection state changes.
